<h1>The Power of SUID</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of configuring a Set-User Identification (SUID) on one of the system's binaries to copy classified data with a regular user.
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>VirtualBox</b>
- <b>Debian Environment</b>
- <b>Terminal</b>

<h2>Setting a Binary with SUID:</h2>
A binary is set with SUID to allow a regular user to access classified data. To do this, terminal is first logged in under our regular user:<br/>

<br />
<br />
A file named secret.txt is created on the desktop. To verify, the Desktop directory is listed:<br/>

<br />
<br />
Attempting to copy the contents of the shadow file to secret.txt will prompt a command due to insufficient permissions:<br/>

<br />
<br />
Attempting to print the contents of secret.txt will note that it is still an empty file:<br/>

<br />
<br />
The permissions of the shadow file are then printed using the ls -l command. This shows that only the root user has access to this file:<br/>

<br />
<br />
The root user is switched to using su -:<br/>

<br />
<br />
The permissions are then printed again, noting that it does not use SUID:<br/>

<br />
<br />
A SUID is set on the cp binary to allow its execution with root permissions:<br/>

<br />
<br />
The user is returned to using the exit command:<br/>

<br />
<br />
Attempting to print the contents of the secret.txt file this time around will prove that the previous command was successful:<br/>

<br />
<br />
The binary permissions are then returned to their former state:<br/>

<br />
<br />
In terms of Linux Security, SUID plays a major role. It can grant or deny access to certain files within the sytstem by providing permissions to run the file as its owner. This is key, due to some files being only accesible through the root user. Using the root user is bad practice, due to it having complete control over the system with no restrictions. This can cause detrimental security incidents if handled incorrectly.

<h2>SUDO:</h2>
The new user will be provided with the ability to use high-level permissions in the system. This will allow the user to perform sensitive operations without having to switch to the root user. First, the root user is accessed and apt update is executed:<br/>

<br />
<br />
Then, apt install sudo -y is run:<br/>

<br />
<br />
The command visudo is then executed to open and edit the sudoers file:<br/>

<br />
<br />
After scrolling to the bottom, the following text string is entered underneath the root user:<br/>

<br />
<br />
The sudo cat command is run on /etc/shadow to verify that the John user was added to the sudoers list. A password is prompted:<br/>
